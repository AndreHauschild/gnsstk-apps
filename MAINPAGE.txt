\mainpage GNSS Toolkit Software Library Documentation

The goal of the GNSSTk project is to provide a world class, open source
computing suite to the satellite navigation community. It is our hope
that the GNSSTk will empower its users to perform new research and to
create new applications.

If you haven't already, have a look at the \ref README which is linked
on the menu on the left.

Installation instructions for the toolkit are available in the
\ref INSTALL document, also linked on the menu on the left.

For a description of how to perform common tasks using the gnsstk,
refer to the \ref HOWTO document.
