\subsection HOWTOGettingStarted Getting Started

\li See the detailed documentation...
    1. Make sure Doxygen is installed on your build system by running "doxygen -v"
    2. In the top level directory of the toolkit (where the Doxyfile resides), run doxygen.
    3. In a web browser, open $TKROOT/gnsstk_doc_dir/html/index.html

\li Build the toolkit...
    1. Refer to \ref INSTALL

\subsection HOWTOApps Applications

\li Convert time between different formats...
    1. Use the \ref timeconvert application.  Running timeconvert without command-line arguments will show the current time (UTC) in a variety of formats.
    2. Use \ref timeconvert with one of the myriad command-line arguments to specify a time in one of the supported formats (ANSI, civil, RINEX, etc.)
    3. Use \ref timeconvert with the -F command-line argument to use a specific output format.  Refer to printTime() for documentation on the supported format tokens.  Example: <br/><tt> timeconvert -F "%4Y-%02m-%02dT%02H:%02M:%02SZ" </tt><br/> will display the current UTC time in ISO-8601 format.
    4. Use \ref timeconvert with the \c --input-format and \c --input-time arguments to specify a time in a format not explicitly supported by the existing options.  Refer to printTime() for documentation on the supported format tokens.  Example: <br/><tt> timeconvert --input-format="%Y %j %H:%M:%S" --input-time="2020 20 20:20:20" </tt><br/> processes time from a "Year day-of-year hour:minute:second" format.
    
\li Manipulate RINEX files...
    1. Use the RinEdit application to perform a wide variety of tweaks to RINEX OBS data files.
    2. Use the RinDump application to generate a space-separated table of data from a RINEX input file.
    3. Use the RinSum application to generate a table of counts of observables from a RINEX OBS file.

\li See a GPS calendar with week number and day of year
    1. \ref calgps with no arguments will show a calendar for the current month and year.
    2. \ref calgps with the \c -y argument will produce a calendar for the current year.
    3. \ref calgps with the \c -Y \c YEAR argument will produce a calendar for YEAR.

\subsection HOWTOCode Library Use

\li Use time data in my code...
    1. Refer to \ref TimeHandlingGuide for guidance.
    2. Refer to the classes in the \ref TimeHandling module for reference documentation.

\li Generate correlation codes...
    1. Refer to the \ref CodeGen module for reference documentation.

\li Decode as-broadcast navigation messages...
    1. Refer to the classes in the \ref GNSSEph module for reference documentation.

\subsection HOWTOContribute Contribute Code

\li Contribute code...
   1. Follow the style guide, if we ever add it from the wiki to the code base.
   2. Document your code using doxygen as described in \ref DoxygenGuide

Defining some pages here so that they will appear after all of the
super-important stuff that we want at the top of the navigation bar,
but before the other pages.
