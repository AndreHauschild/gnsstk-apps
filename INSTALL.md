Introduction:
-------------

The most up-to-date project information can be found at the project website, 
including build and install instructions, the latest project news, a support 
forum, IRC, and contact information:

    http://www.gnsstk.org/

The easiest way to build an install GNSSTk is to use the shell script provided 
with the source distribution. See below for more details on use of the script, 
details on building on POSIX platforms, and where to get instructions for 
building with CMake, both with Xcode on OSX and Visual Studio on Windows.


Dependencies:
-------------

This project uses CMake for all of its configuration, build, install & testing tasks.
   
    http://www.cmake.org/

This project uses SWIG for generation of python bindings for the C++
library. Currently (March 2016) there seems to be problems with using swig 3.x to
build the bindings. 2.0.12 is the newest this has been successfull.
    http://www.swig.org/

This project (optionally) uses doxygen to dynamically generate API documentation.
   
    http://www.doxygen.org/

This project (optionally) uses Sphinx for generating the python bindings documentation.
   
    http://sphinx-doc.org/


UNIX-like Environment: Automatic build and install
-------------------------------------------

This section describes build and installation under the following environments:

   - Linux, OSX, Solaris

The following procedure will build and install the GNSSTk.

   1. Ensure that prerequisites such as cmake and swig have been installed.

   2. Obtain the GNSSTk source distribution.

   3. If needed, extract the GNSSTk compressed archive.
      For example, using GNU tar and gunzip:

         $ tar -xvzf gnsstk.tgz

   4. Navigate to the root directory of the extract GNSSTk file tree, herein
      called $gnsstk_root:

         $ cd $gnsstk_root
         
    5. Execute the build script to build and install to the user's ~/.local dir
        
        $ ./build.sh -eu


UNIX-like Environment: Manual Build, Install, and Package:
----------------------------------------------------------

If you instead prefer or need to run commands one at a time, run the following 
commands instead of build.sh:

   1. If you want documentation of the C++ classes and improved python 
      docstrings:

         $ cd $gnsstk_root

         $ doxygen 

   2. Create a directory for your build:

         $ cd $gnsstk_root

         $ mkdir $gnsstk_root/build

   3. Change into the $gnsstk_root/build directory, this will be where all of the
      build files will reside.

   4. If you prefer to build and install GNSSTk as a system library in /usr/local, 
      execute the following commands:

         $ cd $gnsstk_root/build

         $ cmake $gnsstk_root

         $ make

         $ make install 

   5. If you prefer to build and install GNSSTk as a user library in $HOME/.local, 
      skip the previous step, and instead execute the following commands:

         $ cd $gnsstk_root/build

         $ cmake -DPYTHON_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local/gnsstk -DBUILD_EXT=1 $gnsstk_root

         $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.local/gnsstk/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

         $ make

         $ make install 

         $ export PATH=$HOME/.local/gnsstk/bin:$PATH

   6. If you want to package the binaries into a tarball, execute the following commands:

         $ cd $gnsstk_root/build

         $ cmake -DPYTHON_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local/gnsstk $gnsstk_root

         $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.local/gnsstk/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

         $ make       

         $ make package



Windows and Microsoft Visual Studio: Building with CMake:
---------------------------------------------------------

Step-by-step procedure with pictures on building, installing, and testing the GNSSTk under Visual Studio 
2012 can be found at gnsstk.org:

    http://www.gnsstk.org/bin/view/Documentation/BuildingGNSSTkUnderWindows


Linking Against the GNSSTk Library:
----------------------------------

If you are developing against your install of GNSSTk, and have added
the relevant GNSSTk library \#include statements in you implementation file,
then the simplest example of building your application in a Bash script 
would look like this:

    INPUT=Your_App.cpp
    OUTPUT=Your_App.exe
    GNSSTK_INSTALL=$HOME/.local/gnsstk
    COMPILER="gcc -Wall"

    COMMAND_STRING="$COMPILER -I$GNSSTK_INSTALL/include -L$GNSSTK_INSTALL/lib -lgnsstk -o $OUTPUT $INPUT"
    echo "$COMMAND_STRING"
    eval $COMMAND_STRING

Notes on the python bindings
-------------------------
Under common Linux distributions (Debian, Ubunu, CentOS, RedHat), the
python bindings just build, install, and work (TM).

Under other OSs, things are a little more fussy.

As of March 2016 on OX X 10.11 (El Capitan), ```build.sh -u``` will
install the python bindings to ~/.local/lib/python2.7...
It doesn't appear that the python provided with OS X will
automatically load from this path.
